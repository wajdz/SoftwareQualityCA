## # What are Coding Standards? 
Coding Standards are a collection of rules that programmers adhere to when utilizing a certain programming language on a given project. These standards include written language definitions for a broad range of topics, including programming processes, styles, and methodologies for every facet of the program.

### Why Coding Standards are Important? 
Coding standards support the production of high-caliber software and code by your team. But what exactly is meant by "high-quality code"?

You and your users may be sure that your software is dependable, safe, and secure when it has high-quality code. You and your team will profit when your code satisfies these three requirements.

#### How to follow Coding Standards:
1. Is there legible code?
2. Will you comprehend what is happening if you go back to the code later?
3. What kind of code base comments are you making?
4. Have you produced more effective code that is more difficult to read but quicker to write?
A team can start drafting their Coding Standards paper after taking into account the aforementioned four elements.

##### Benefits Offered by Coding Standards:

**Decreased Failure Rate:** Coding standards improve source code's efficiency and readability, which helps developers better comprehend code modules. By guaranteeing appropriate architecture and module coupling, this effectively meets customer requests and lowers project failure rates.

**Optimized Development Time:** By lowering errors and guaranteeing code quality, coding standards implementation expedites development time. By completing projects on schedule, this helps software development companies stay competitive and gain the trust of their clients.

**Easier Debugging:** By making code more readable and organized, coding standards make debugging easier. This is particularly beneficial when debugging is carried out by developers who are not the original authors of the code since it saves time and effort.

**Economical Maintenance:** Development time and expenses are decreased by the ease of reuse and maintenance of standardized code. Even in the event that the original developer is not there, it enables simple code functionality references. To further enhance system flexibility, coding standards can be modified to satisfy organisational needs.

Even when coding best practices are followed, extensive testing on actual browsers and devices is crucial. It is advised to use a real device cloud for instantaneous testing with real devices, browsers, and operating systems, as emulators and simulators may have restrictions. Accurate performance testing is made possible by testing on real devices in the cloud. This ensures thorough and error-free testing to find major flaws before production. In the end, this strategy improves the software's user experience.

## Uphold Coding Standards More Easily with Automated Tools
Adopting coding standards is a basic practice that improves readability, security, consistency, and software development. It is commonly acknowledged that popular coding standards are best practices that make it easier for teams to produce clean, well-written code.  

Without the appropriate resources, it can be difficult to keep coding standards across a team or project. Tools for static code analysis are a great place to start. By automating the code analysis and review process, tools such as linters can greatly simplify the process for teams adhering to defined coding standards.

Developers can find potential problems such as coding errors, stylistic inconsistencies, bugs, coding standard violations, and security vulnerabilities by using linters to examine their source code.

## Documentation Standards
A coding standards document should first and foremost make it clear that it is not about right and wrong. It has nothing to do with right and wrong or superior methods.

To make it easier for developers to switch from one person's work to another without needing to change their mindset to read someone else's style, coding standards documents ensure that all code is designed, written, and organised uniformly.


Nothing about "Right and wrong"â€”all that matters is uniformity.

Because of this, the following points need to be made clear in a document on coding standards:

- Conventions for Naming : What names will you give to your classes, variables, interfaces, and methods? Which notation are you going to use?
- Indentation : Regarding indentation, what will you be using? Just one tab? Three gaps?
- Layout : Will the braces be maintained on the line that represents the opening method? 
- Logging/Exception Handling - What are your standards for handling exceptions and logging? Do you use in-house tools or do you make use of third-party ones? How ought one to apply it?
- Making a comment - Grammar correctness is governed by standards, and comments must start on the line before or after, not on the same line, as this improves readability. 
For descriptions, how about the \\\ on Methods? Are these intended for use? When?
- Availability : Should all of your methods and fields have the lowest possible level of access?
