## Introduction

Welcome to our Software Quality Handbook!


 This document is designed to provide our software engineering team with a standardized set of best practices to enhance the quality of our projects. By adopting these guidelines, we aim to improve predictability, reduce defects in production, and establish a more efficient and cohesive workflow.

This handbook is structured into sections, each focusing on a key aspect of software development. Each section will briefly introduce the topic, highlight important guidelines, and provide links to valuable resources offering personal insights and experiences.


This is a manual for the company that outlines Codeck Software's software quality assurance procedures and policies. Software engineers and quality assurance teams within the organization should utilize this manual to follow best practices and work the "Right Way."
 Since each employee has a different programming style, this handbook will be extremely helpful to the business when onboarding new hires.
  
 It will also enable all employees to be on the same page.
This document serves as a standard for task estimation in scrum, coding standards, and code reviews throughout the organisation. 
The goal of this manual is to lower the possibility that flaws and unpredictable events may find their way into production. 
This guide will provide a quick overview of the subject and highlight the best practices and standards selected based on the authors' own experiences in each of the three categories. When appropriate, references to additional articles will be given for reading.
Each topic will have its own Introduction in each file, explaining each topic briefly and then going into detail with links to articles etc.
