## Task Estimation in Scrum
 

In Scrum, estimating effort entails giving a task a size or time estimate. It is possible to estimate the amount of effort needed to finish it with accuracy thanks to this foresight. Any scrum master's toolkit for this purpose should include techniques like Ideal Days, Story Points, and Planning Poker.
Accurate task estimation is crucial for effective project planning in the Scrum framework. The goal is not only to deliver on time but also to set realistic expectations for stakeholders. In this section, we'll explore the challenges of task estimation and provide guidelines for improvement.

## Key Guidelines


 1.  ### Understand the User Stories:

The main aim is to develop a clear and well-defined problem-solving strategy for our team. Therefore, each department will conduct a small in-house meeting to identify the source of errors encountered at the end of the production line. 
The following acceptance criteria must be incorporated into the project for the project to have the best outcomes for the consumers and the project engineers.


•	Production cost reduction without compromising on the quality of the product.

•	Ensuring that both the functional and non-functional aspects of the quality are increased and streamlined.

•	Ensure scalability and sustainability aspects are incorporated into the system. 



2. ### Collaborative Estimation:

•	Conduct estimation sessions as a team using techniques like Planning Poker.

•	Encourage open discussions to share different perspectives.

Like having the full house in your game of poker. The same strategy will be used to generate hidden price estimation costs by each team member required for each proposal brought forth. This way we will get to have a better consensus on the actual estimates to be used in the project operation streamlining. 
Each member will have the opportunity to say why they think their estimates get to win the estimation strategy during the meeting.

3. ###	Use Historical Data:

•	Refer to past project data for similar tasks to improve estimation accuracy.

•	Maintain a historical record of completed tasks and their estimates.

By borrowing from our company’s historical records we can identify the leakages and sources of the loss of efficiency in our operations. Therefore, a software system will be used to analyze our historical data to help predict the most vulnerable aspects of our operations.

4. ###	Consider Dependencies:

•	Identify and account for dependencies between tasks.

Intra-Team Dependencies will be used in a single scrum team to work to streamline individual teams for example, several team members under the same department will be paired with each other within the Sprint backlog identified from the historical data to find the best possible outcome.

Identifying and establishing Dependency Mitigation Strategies. Possible sources of overestimation can result from power imbalances in the teams and lack of proper internal arrangement and team coordination that negatively affect team-level outcomes. Furthermore, a lack of proper interdisciplinary team cohesion can result in a lack of proper communication across the company


5. ###	Update Estimates as Needed:

•	Regularly revisit and update estimates based on new information.

•	Adjust estimates during sprint retrospectives as necessary.

We will have weekly team briefings and monthly overall assessments with briefings to update on the estimates and readjust the sprints as needed. 

**Why use Planning Poker? :**
- Enables the group to assign work according to each other.
- A plan that the team members contributed to feels more devoted to, and as a result, the outcome is typically better.
- Potential problems are found early on instead of later.
- Generates fresh concepts. Talking about a user narrative can stimulate ideas that could lead to a solution that is optimized at a lower estimate.

**Prioritize the Five Core Metrics**

Project managers are recommended to concentrate solely on Five Core Metrics in order to provide precise and reliable estimates, so minimizing the initial fear and messiness that may accompany beginning a huge new project:
- Duration
- Effort
- Size
- Productivity
- Reliability

Larry Putnam Sr., who wrote a book on these Five Metrics had the following argument:
"by simplifying the estimation process and tuning into the areas that truly matter can help managers better assess risk factors, anticipate and respond to changes, and successfully re-plan their projects as necessary. It addresses the common misperception that software project estimation is too hard and complicated. That certainly does not have to be the case."
